## Notes on this Version

Just wanted to develop a more concise version; found that lessons involve sometimes tedious, confusing details that could be trimmed down. Also wanted to get rid of sound entirely; kids importing sounds turns into an unmanageable racket and the temptation to play the sounds over and over is too great.
